## Project Background
What is customer churn and why it matters?
+ Churn is the rate at which customers stop using a service, and it matters because high churn directly reduces revenue, increases acquisition costs, and signals issues with customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Business Question:
+	Why do some subscribers leave while others stayâ€”and how can we act on it??

## Objectives
**1. Analyze customer behavior and churn trends**
+ Identify customer segments with the highest churn rates.
+	Estimate revenue loss from churn and highlight which groups contribute most to it.
+ Uncover overall behavioral patterns linked to customer retention and attrition.
**2.	Identify key churn and retention drivers**
+	Determine the top factors that strongly influence whether customers stay or leave.
+	Provide insights into customer behaviors that signal loyalty versus churn risk.
**3. Build a predictive churn model**
+	Develop and evaluate a logistic regression model using scikit-learn to predict customer churn, with performance assessed through accuracy, precision, and recall.
**4. Translate insights into business actions**
+	Deliver a clear, actionable report with strategies to reduce churn and improve retention.
+	Recommend targeted actions (e.g., engagement campaigns, pricing strategies, support improvements) based on findings.
